# My-Best-Tweets
Uses Node.js and Twitter API to show a user his/her most popular tweets!

## To run

Clone project, then run from command line:

```
nodemon main.js
```

Then navigate to **localhost:3000** in your browser.

Jk don't know if that will work because the twitter authentication file is hidden lol
